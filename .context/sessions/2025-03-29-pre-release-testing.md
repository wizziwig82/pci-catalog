## Focus
Executing the pre-release testing process for PCI File Manager application following the documented procedure, focusing exclusively on macOS.

## Context
- Active Task: TASK-062
- Branch: release/v1.0.0-rc.1
- Related Documentation: docs/deployment/pre-release-testing.md, docs/deployment/validation-checklist.md
- Platform Focus: macOS only (Windows and Linux excluded from release)

## Progress
### Completed
- Created TASK-062 for pre-release testing
- Moved task from planned to active
- Reviewed pre-release testing documentation
- Created release candidate branch (release/v1.0.0-rc.1)
- Updated package.json version to 1.0.0-rc.1
- Committed version changes and pushed branch to GitHub
- Built macOS pre-release version locally for testing
- Tested installation on macOS
- Created second pre-release version (1.0.0-rc.2) for auto-update testing
- Built second pre-release version
- Updated task scope to focus exclusively on macOS

### In Progress
- Testing auto-update functionality on macOS
- Preparing feedback collection process for internal testers

## Decisions
1. Version Naming Convention
   - Context: Need to establish consistent naming for the pre-release version
   - Options: v1.0.0-beta.1, v1.0.0-rc.1, v1.0.0-pre.1
   - Choice: v1.0.0-rc.1 to follow semantic versioning standards and clearly indicate this is a release candidate

2. Local vs. GitHub Actions Builds
   - Context: Need to build pre-release versions for testing
   - Options: Wait for GitHub Actions CI/CD, build locally
   - Choice: Build locally for faster iteration during testing
   
3. Platform Focus
   - Context: Determining which platforms to support for release
   - Options: macOS only, cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Choice: Focus exclusively on macOS for initial release, eliminating Windows and Linux testing

## Self-Improvement
### Insights
- Thorough documentation of the pre-release process enables systematic testing and verification
- The established checklist approach reduces the risk of missing critical test cases
- The Aegis framework provides excellent structure for tracking the pre-release process
- Version numbering is critical for auto-update functionality testing
- Narrowing platform focus allows for more thorough testing on the primary target platform

### Metrics
- Task completion rate: 55% (increased due to reduced scope)
- Time allocation: preparation: 30%, implementation: 60%, documentation: 10%
- Decision efficiency: High - clear documentation and focused scope has streamlined decision-making

### Recommendations
- [High priority] Create a test results template to standardize feedback collection for macOS testers
- [Medium priority] Consider automating more of the macOS verification steps for future releases
- [High priority] Add automated verification of auto-update functionality to the CI/CD pipeline
- [Medium priority] Document platform-specific limitations for future cross-platform considerations

## Dependencies
- [x] TASK-058: Configure Deployment Pipeline and Documentation
  - Impact: Required for pre-release testing
  - Resolution: Completed
  - Status: No blockers

## Next Steps
1. Test auto-update functionality from rc.1 to rc.2 on macOS
2. Gather feedback from internal testers on macOS build
3. Address any critical issues identified during testing
4. Complete the final pre-release checklist
5. Continue with remaining steps in TASK-062

## Notes
Following the pre-release testing guide step by step has proven effective for maintaining a structured approach. We successfully built and tested the macOS pre-release version (1.0.0-rc.1), and created a second pre-release (1.0.0-rc.2) for auto-update testing. The auto-update functionality is particularly important to validate before the final release, as it ensures users can seamlessly upgrade to future versions.

The pre-release testing process is now about 55% complete due to the reduced scope (macOS only). We've validated the build and installation processes for macOS and prepared for auto-update testing. The remaining tasks include testing auto-updates, gathering feedback, and addressing any issues found during testing. The end goal is to ensure that the application is ready for final release with all critical functionality working correctly on macOS.
