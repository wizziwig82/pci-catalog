# Begin Work on TASK-021 - Simplified Deployment Execution

## Focus

The focus of this session is to begin work on TASK-021 (Execute Deployment and Distribution) with a significantly simplified scope based on actual requirements. Instead of the full enterprise deployment process, we'll focus on creating a local DMG and pushing the release to a personal GitHub repository.

## Context

- **Current State**: TASK-019 (Finalize PCI File Manager for Initial Release) has been completed, and TASK-021 has been created to handle deployment.
- **Simplified Requirements**: 
  - Local DMG creation only, no distribution to servers
  - Regular GitHub repository, not GitHub Enterprise
  - No stakeholder notifications needed
  - No training or support preparation required
  - Single developer workflow

The PCI File Manager is ready for its initial release, with a macOS deployment package already prepared. We now need to finalize the versioning, create the local DMG file, and push the release to GitHub.

## Progress

We're starting TASK-021 with a revised approach that focuses only on the essentials:

1. **Revised Step 1: Version Control Operations**
   - Create a release branch according to versioning strategy
   - Tag the release with appropriate version (v1.0.0)
   - Update version numbers in package.json and other files
   - Push changes and tags to personal GitHub repository

2. **Revised Step 2: Local DMG Creation**
   - Build the macOS DMG installer locally
   - Verify the DMG file works correctly
   - Store the DMG in a local directory for safekeeping

3. **Revised Step 3: GitHub Release**
   - Create a GitHub release for the tagged version
   - Add release notes to the GitHub release
   - No asset upload necessary

All other steps from the original task will be skipped as they're not required for this simplified workflow.

## Self-Improvement

### Applicable Insights

1. **Effective adaptation from complex features to essential tasks improves deployment focus** (PI-012)
   - Applying this by simplifying the deployment process to match actual needs
   - Focusing only on essential steps rather than enterprise deployment

2. **Test mode implementation for build and deployment scripts dramatically reduces iteration time** (EI-011)
   - Will use this for local DMG creation and testing

3. **Platform-specific focus allows for more streamlined development and deployment** (PI-013)
   - Continuing with macOS-only focus

## Dependencies

- TASK-019: Finalize PCI File Manager for Initial Release (Completed)

## Next Steps

1. Check current version in package.json
2. Create a release branch
3. Update version numbers
4. Build the macOS DMG locally
5. Verify the DMG works correctly
6. Tag the release
7. Push to GitHub
8. Create GitHub release

## Notes

- The simplified approach focuses only on what's needed for a personal project
- We'll use existing build scripts from TASK-019 to create the DMG
- No distribution to file servers or enterprise systems is needed
- This approach saves time while still maintaining proper versioning
