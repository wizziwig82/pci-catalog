# Aegis Start Session - Project Status and Next Tasks

## Focus

The focus of this session is to assess the current state of the PCI File Manager project, evaluate the completion of TASK-019, and determine the next priority tasks. After review, we have decided to prioritize immediate deployment activities over additional feature work.

## Context

- **Current State**: TASK-019 (Finalize PCI File Manager for Initial Release) has been successfully completed with all steps finished
- **Project Phase**: The application is now ready for its initial release with a fully functional macOS installer
- **Key Accomplishments**: Created a comprehensive macOS deployment package, including installers, documentation, and verification tools
- **Self-Improvement**: Several insights have been applied from previous sessions, particularly around platform-specific focus and comprehensive release checklists

The PCI File Manager is an Electron-based desktop application for managing files with integration to Cloudflare R2 for storage and MongoDB for metadata. The application has gone through the development cycle and is now ready for initial release, with a focus on macOS as the first supported platform.

## Progress

In reviewing the completed TASK-019, the following achievements have been noted:

1. **Comprehensive Test Plan**: Established test cases for all core functionality, defined acceptance criteria, and documented test procedures.

2. **Finalized Documentation**: Completed user guides, administrative documentation, API documentation, and release notes.

3. **Installation Verification Tools**: Created tools to verify MongoDB connection, R2 storage connection, and system requirements.

4. **Security Review**: Performed comprehensive security verification with tools checking authentication, encryption, API security, and more.

5. **Deployment Package**: Created a complete macOS deployment package with proper entitlements, background images, and verification tools.

Additionally, during this session:

1. We've evaluated project priorities and decided to focus on deployment immediately
2. Put TASK-020 (Manual Backup and Maintenance Procedures) on hold
3. Created TASK-021 (Execute Deployment and Distribution) as our current focus
4. Updated the session focus to reflect this strategic shift

The TASK-019 has been fully completed, making the application ready for its initial release.

## Self-Improvement

### Applicable Insights

1. **Platform-specific focus allows for more streamlined development and deployment** (PI-013)
   - Successfully applied by focusing exclusively on macOS for the initial release
   - Resulted in a higher quality installer with platform-specific optimizations

2. **Test mode implementation for build and deployment scripts dramatically reduces iteration time** (EI-011)
   - Applied to installer creation with test scripts for faster verification
   - Enabled rapid iteration on the macOS DMG creation process

3. **Comprehensive release checklists significantly reduce the risk of oversights during deployment** (PI-014)
   - Created detailed checklists to verify all aspects of the release
   - Ensured no critical steps were missed in the final preparation

### Recommendations Applied

1. **[High Priority]** Applied the test-mode pattern to installer creation
2. **[Medium Priority]** Documented the macOS installation process thoroughly
3. **[Low Priority]** Created post-installation verification steps in test scripts

## Dependencies

All dependencies for the completed TASK-019 have been addressed:
- ✅ MongoDB integration (TASK-015)
- ✅ R2 storage integration (TASK-016)
- ✅ Security hardening (TASK-018)

## Next Steps

After reviewing the project status and considering priorities, we have decided to:

1. **Put TASK-020 on hold** - We've moved the "Manual Backup and Maintenance Procedures" task to the hold state to focus on deployment first. 

2. **Created and Activated TASK-021** - We've created a new task "Execute Deployment and Distribution" to formalize the deployment activities and execution process according to DEC-027.

3. **Prioritize Deployment Activities** - We will immediately focus on:
   - Finalizing the deployment checklist
   - Executing the release process as defined in DEC-027
   - Tagging the release in version control
   - Uploading assets to distribution channels
   - Notifying internal stakeholders

4. **Post-Deployment Support** - Once deployment is complete, we'll establish monitoring and gather initial feedback before resuming work on TASK-020.

## Notes

- The project has successfully transitioned from development to release-ready state
- The focus on macOS as the initial platform has proven to be a good decision, allowing for a higher quality release
- The comprehensive verification tools and checklists will serve as a foundation for future releases
- We've decided to prioritize immediate deployment over additional pre-release tasks
- TASK-020 will be resumed after successful deployment
