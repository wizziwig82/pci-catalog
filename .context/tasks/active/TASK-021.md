# Execute Deployment and Distribution

## Description

With TASK-019 (Finalize PCI File Manager for Initial Release) completed, this task focuses on executing a simplified deployment process. Rather than an enterprise deployment, we'll focus on creating a local DMG installer and pushing the release to a personal GitHub repository.

## Objectives

- Tag the release in version control with appropriate version
- Update version numbers in all relevant files
- Build a local macOS DMG installer
- Push the release to GitHub with proper tags
- Create a GitHub release with release notes

## Steps

1. **Version Control Operations**
   - Create release branch according to versioning strategy
   - Tag the release with appropriate version (v1.0.0)
   - Update version numbers in package.json and other files
   - Push changes and tags to GitHub repository

2. **Local DMG Creation**
   - Build the macOS DMG installer locally
   - Verify the DMG file works correctly
   - Store the DMG in a local directory for safekeeping

3. **GitHub Release**
   - Create a GitHub release for the tagged version
   - Add release notes to the GitHub release
   - Document the release process for future reference

## Progress

Task has been modified to reflect a simplified deployment process based on actual needs. We're now focusing only on version control operations, local DMG creation, and GitHub release management.

## Dependencies

- TASK-019: Finalize PCI File Manager for Initial Release (Completed)

## Notes

- The simplified deployment process focuses only on what's needed for a personal project
- We'll use existing build scripts from TASK-019 to create the DMG
- No distribution to file servers or enterprise systems is needed
- No stakeholder notifications or training materials are required
- This streamlined approach aligns with self-improvement insight PI-012 on focusing only on essential tasks

## Next Steps

1. Check current version in package.json
2. Create a release branch
3. Update version numbers
4. Build the macOS DMG locally
5. Verify the DMG works correctly
6. Tag the release
7. Push to GitHub
8. Create GitHub release
