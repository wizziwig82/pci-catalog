## Description
Execute the pre-release testing process for the PCI File Manager application, following the documented process in docs/deployment/pre-release-testing.md. This task involves creating a pre-release branch, making test builds, testing macOS installation, verifying auto-updates, gathering feedback, and resolving any issues before the final release.

## Objectives
- Create a pre-release branch and build for testing
- Test installation process on macOS
- Verify auto-update functionality works correctly
- Identify and resolve any issues before final release
- Document test results and any known issues

## Steps
- [x] Create a release candidate branch following the documented process
- [x] Update version for pre-release in package.json
- [x] Commit changes and push the release candidate branch
- [x] Build pre-release version for macOS
- [x] Test installation on macOS
- [x] Create a second pre-release version for auto-update testing
- [ ] Test auto-update functionality on macOS
- [ ] Gather feedback from internal testers
- [ ] Prioritize and resolve any critical issues
- [ ] Document any known issues that can't be fixed before release
- [ ] Complete final pre-release checklist
- [ ] Prepare for final release

## Progress
Task activated and in progress. Created release candidate branch (release/v1.0.0-rc.1), updated package.json with pre-release version (1.0.0-rc.1), and pushed the branch to the remote repository. Built the macOS pre-release version locally with electron-builder. The build process completed successfully and generated a DMG installer file. Tested installation on macOS which verified that the application launches correctly with the pre-release version. Created a second pre-release version (1.0.0-rc.2) for auto-update testing and built it successfully. Next step is to test the auto-update functionality on macOS.

Note: Based on updated requirements, we're focusing only on macOS for this release and eliminating Windows and Linux platform testing.

## Dependencies
- TASK-058: Configure Deployment Pipeline and Documentation (completed)
  - The deployment pipeline and documentation must be completed before pre-release testing

## Notes
This task is critical for ensuring a smooth final release of the PCI File Manager application. All critical issues must be addressed before proceeding to the final release. The pre-release testing process should focus exclusively on macOS as that is the only platform we're targeting for release.

## Next Steps
1. Test auto-update functionality from rc.1 to rc.2 on macOS
2. Gather feedback from internal testers
3. Address any critical issues identified during testing
4. Complete the final pre-release checklist
