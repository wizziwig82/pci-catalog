# Manual Backup and Maintenance Procedures

## Description

Without an automated update mechanism, it's critical to establish reliable manual procedures for backing up data, performing maintenance, and handling future updates. This task involves creating comprehensive documentation and simple utilities to help users maintain their PCI File Manager installation, back up important data, and safely apply updates when needed.

## Objectives

- Create comprehensive manual backup procedures for all critical data
- Develop maintenance schedules and procedures for optimal performance
- Establish a safe manual update process for future application versions
- Provide data recovery procedures for various failure scenarios
- Create simple utilities to assist with common maintenance tasks

## Steps

1. **Backup Procedure Development**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for backing up MongoDB data
   - Develop procedures for backing up R2 storage data
   - Create schedule recommendations for regular backups
   - Develop verification procedures for backup integrity
   - Create simple scripts to assist with backup process

2. **Maintenance Schedule and Procedures**
   - Develop recommended maintenance schedule
   - Create procedures for database optimization
   - Document log rotation and management
   - Provide guidelines for system resource monitoring
   - Create procedures for cleaning up temporary files

3. **Manual Update Process**
   - Establish a safe procedure for manual application updates
   - Create pre-update checklist for critical preparations
   - Develop data migration guidelines for version changes
   - Document rollback procedures for failed updates
   - Create verification steps for post-update testing

4. **Data Recovery Procedures**
   - Document recovery procedures for database corruption
   - Create procedures for restoring from backups
   - Develop troubleshooting guide for common failure scenarios
   - Create data validation utilities
   - Document emergency recovery options

5. **Maintenance Utilities**
   - Create simple database verification utility
   - Develop backup verification tool
   - Create storage consistency checker
   - Implement log analyzer for troubleshooting
   - Develop simple health check dashboard

## Progress

This task has been placed on hold to prioritize deployment activities. Will resume after deployment is complete.

## Dependencies

- TASK-016: Simplified Production Deployment Planning (Completed)
- TASK-019: Pre-Deployment Verification and Final Preparation (Planned)

## Notes

- All procedures should be accessible to users with basic technical skills
- Focus on reliability and safety rather than complexity
- Include detailed step-by-step instructions with screenshots
- Consider creating video tutorials for complex procedures
- Ensure all procedures work across supported platforms
- Task placed on hold (2025-03-27) to focus on immediate deployment needs

## Next Steps

1. Review existing backup capabilities in the application
2. Identify critical data stores requiring backup procedures
3. Research best practices for MongoDB backup and recovery
4. Develop and test backup scripts for R2 storage
5. Create template for maintenance procedure documentation
