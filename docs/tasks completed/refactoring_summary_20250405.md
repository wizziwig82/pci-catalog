# Project Refactoring Summary (2025-04-05)

This document summarizes the refactoring work completed for the Music Library Manager project.

## 1. Analysis and Planning

*   Initial analysis of the project structure was performed.
*   A detailed reorganization plan was created by the architect mode and documented in `docs/reorganization-plan.md`.

## 2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Refactoring

*   Conservative refactoring based on the Single Responsibility Principle was applied to several large files.
*   This involved extracting specific logic and components (e.g., UI components, utility functions) into separate, more focused modules to improve maintainability and reduce complexity.

## 3. Project Reorganization

*   Files and directories were restructured according to the `docs/reorganization-plan.md`.
*   References (imports, paths) across the codebase were updated to reflect the new structure.
*   A potential configuration issue related to `@sveltejs/adapter-auto` was noted during this phase, requiring further investigation if deployment issues arise.

## 4. Cleanup

*   Unused dependencies were identified and removed from `package.json`.
*   Obsolete code, configuration files, build scripts, and other unused assets were deleted from the repository.
