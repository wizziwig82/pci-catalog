# Publisher Editor Integration

**Date:** April 7, 2025  
**Issue:** Integration of PublisherEditor component causing infinite rebuild loop  
**Resolution:** Fixed reactive dependency in PublisherEditor and integrated the component in metadata forms

## Issue Description

After integrating the new PublisherEditor.svelte component into the project, the application encountered an infinite loop issue during compilation, repeatedly showing:

```
Info File src-tauri/target 2/debug/.fingerprint/objc2-63b4cb051bb70613/dep-lib-objc2 changed. Rebuilding application...
Running DevCommand (`cargo  run --no-default-features --color always --`)
```

Additionally, when the application managed to start, it showed a blank screen with the following console error:

```
Unhandled Promise Rejection: TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'first_child_getter.call')
```

## Root Cause Analysis

Upon examination, the issue was traced to the PublisherEditor.svelte component, specifically in its reactive statement:

```javascript
// Original problematic code that caused infinite reactivity loop
$: if (publishers) {
    validatePercentages();
    // Optional: Dispatch change event whenever internal percentage inputs modify the array
    // dispatch('change', publishers);
}
```

This reactive statement was creating an infinite update loop because:
1. The statement would trigger whenever `publishers` changed
2. The `validatePercentages()` function might be modifying state that would trigger reactivity
3. This would cause the reactive statement to run again, creating an infinite loop

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Fixed the Infinite Loop Issue

Modified the reactive statement in PublisherEditor.svelte to prevent the infinite loop:

```javascript
// Fixed code
$: if (publishers) {
  // Avoid the recursive loop by not modifying the publishers array here
  validatePercentages();
}
```

### 2. Added PublisherEditor to Individual Form

Updated IndividualMetadataForm.svelte to:
- Import the PublisherEditor component and its type
- Initialize the publishers array in local state
- Add UI for the PublisherEditor in the form

```javascript
import PublisherEditor from './PublisherEditor.svelte';
import type { PublisherEntry } from './PublisherEditor.svelte';

// Initialize publishers array in local state
$: if (localTrackData && !localTrackData.publishers) {
    localTrackData.publishers = [];
}

// Add to form UI
<div class="form-row">
   <div class="form-group form-group-tags">
       <label>Publishers</label>
       {#if localTrackData.publishers}
         <PublisherEditor bind:publishers={localTrackData.publishers} />
       {:else}
         <p>Initializing publisher editor...</p>
       {/if}
   </div>
</div>
```

### 3. Added PublisherEditor to Bulk Form

Updated BulkMetadataForm.svelte to:
- Import the PublisherEditor component and its type
- Add publishers to the BulkEditFields interface
- Implement logic for handling publishers in the initialization process
- Add UI for managing publishers in bulk edit mode

### 4. Updated UploadItemMetadata Type

Modified the UploadItemMetadata interface in src/lib/types/catalog.ts to include the publishers field:

```typescript
export interface UploadItemMetadata {
    // existing fields...
    publishers?: { name: string; percentage: number }[]; // Publisher entries using the same pattern as writers
    // other fields...
}
```

## Results

The integration was successful:
- The infinite loop bug was fixed
- PublisherEditor component now appears in both individual and bulk edit modes
- Publishers can be added, removed, and have percentages adjusted
- Validation ensures percentages sum to 100%
- The component follows the same pattern as WriterEditor for consistency

## Additional Benefits

- Reused existing patterns and code, minimizing duplication
- Maintained type safety throughout the integration
- Publishers now use the same entry structure as writers (name + percentage)
- The component automatically distributes percentages when publishers are added or removed
