# Session Summary - 2025-04-03 17:25:40

This document summarizes the key actions and findings during the interactive development session.

*   **Initial Analysis:**
    *   Reviewed project documentation (`PRD.md`, `To-do.md`, `database-catalog-plan.md`) and file structure.
    *   Generated an initial technical assessment report identifying high-level architecture, current state, and potential areas of concern.

*   **Documentation & Codebase Alignment Investigation:**
    *   Investigated the purpose of `drizzle.config.ts` and related schema (`src/lib/server/db/schema.ts`). Confirmed Drizzle ORM is used with SQLite for frontend-specific authentication/session state, separate from the main MongoDB data store.
    *   Investigated Rust credential handling (`src-tauri/src/credentials.rs`, `src-tauri/src/main.rs`), confirming use of `keyring` crate with debug fallback, deprecating old functions.
    *   Confirmed the Rust backend uses the `mongodb` crate, correcting the `async-mongo` mention in the PRD.
    *   Investigated the `mongodb` dependency in the frontend `package.json`, found it unused, and removed it.
    *   Investigated client initialization flow, confirming it's triggered by frontend commands (`init_mongo_client`, `init_r2_client`).
    *   Investigated R2 file security, concluding it depends on bucket defaults as code doesn't set ACLs.
    *   Investigated backend-frontend error handling, identifying a lack of consistent frontend handling.
    *   Could not determine Next.js integration specifics from the codebase.

*   **Code Refactoring & Cleanup:**
    *   Removed dead code from `src-tauri/src/credentials.rs`.
    *   Removed the unused `mongodb` dependency from the frontend `package.json` using `npm uninstall`.
    *   Updated `PRD.md` to reflect findings regarding credential storage, MongoDB driver, and the Drizzle/SQLite usage.

*   **Error Handling Implementation:**
    *   Created `src-tauri/src/error.rs` with `CommandError` enum.
    *   Refactored Rust commands in `src-tauri/src/main.rs` to use `CommandError`.
    *   Added missing Rust dependencies (`env_logger`, `tauri-plugin-shell`) to `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
    *   Created Svelte notification store (`src/lib/stores/notifications.ts`) and display component (`src/lib/components/NotificationsDisplay.svelte`).
    *   Integrated notification display into main layout (`src/routes/+layout.svelte`).
    *   Created `safeInvoke` TypeScript wrapper (`src/lib/utils/invokeWrapper.ts`).
    *   Refactored frontend pages (`settings`, `upload`, `catalog`) to use `safeInvoke`.
    *   Iteratively debugged and fixed Rust compiler errors in `src-tauri/src/main.rs` related to the refactoring (including `FilePath` handling, type mismatches, unused code).

*   **Verification:**
    *   Launched the Tauri application (`npm run tauri:dev`) to confirm successful compilation and basic startup after changes.
