# Session Summary - 2025-04-03

**Goal:** Resolve persistent Rust compilation errors (E0603, E0412, E0659) in `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` related to importing `mongodb::Collection` and using the `bson::doc!` macro.

**Problem:**
- The compiler consistently reported `mongodb::Collection` as private (E0603) or not found (E0412) when imported directly or via its module path (`mongodb::coll::Collection`) within `commands.rs`, despite the standard import working correctly in `storage/mongodb.rs`.
- Importing `bson::doc!` led to ambiguity errors (E0659) with the built-in `#[doc]` attribute.
- Attempts to fix imports using various strategies (direct import, fully qualified path, re-exporting from `storage/mongodb.rs`, type inference) failed to resolve the core issue.
- Proc-macro panics occurred after `cargo clean`, indicating build artifact issues.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1.  Attempted various import strategies for `mongodb::Collection` (`use mongodb::Collection;`, `use mongodb::coll::Collection;`, `use crate::storage::mongodb::Collection;`, fully qualified paths in type annotations, type inference).
2.  Attempted qualifying `doc!` macro calls (`bson::doc!`).
3.  Cleaned Rust build artifacts (`cargo clean` in `src-tauri`).
4.  Removed `node_modules` and `src-tauri/target`, reinstalled dependencies (`npm install`), and performed a full `cargo build`.
5.  Reverted `commands.rs` imports to use `use ::mongodb::bson::{self, doc};` and fully qualified type annotations (`::mongodb::Collection<bson::Document>`).
6.  Ran `cargo build` again after the full clean, which finally succeeded.

**Resolution:**
- The combination of a full environment clean (`rm -rf node_modules`, `rm -rf src-tauri/target`, `npm install`) and using the fully qualified path `::mongodb::Collection<bson::Document>` for type annotations in `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` resolved the persistent compilation errors.
- Importing the `doc!` macro explicitly (`use ::mongodb::bson::{self, doc};`) resolved the E0659 ambiguity errors.

**Outcome:**
- The Rust backend (`src-tauri`) now compiles successfully.
- The application was launched using `npm run tauri dev` and confirmed to be running correctly, with successful initialization of MongoDB and R2 clients and execution of the `fetch_all_tracks` command.
