# Music Catalog Management Application Requirements

**Date**: [Current Date]

Based on the information provided, I'll define specific user requirements and workflows for your music catalog management application that handles audio file uploads to Cloudflare R2 and interfaces with MongoDB.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. User Authentication & Authorization
- Admin login system to control access to the upload/management tool
- Role-based permissions for different levels of catalog management (optional)

### 2. Audio File Management

#### Upload Workflow
1. **File Selection**
   - Batch upload support for multiple files
   - Drag-and-drop interface
   - File browser selection
   - Support for common audio formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC)

2. **Metadata Editing During Upload**
   - Form fields for required MongoDB schema fields:
     - Title
     - Artist
     - Duration (auto-extracted)
     - Audio URL (auto-generated after upload)
   - Form fields for optional metadata:
     - Album
     - Genre
     - Release Year
     - BPM
     - Musical Key
     - Tags (with ability to add multiple tags)

3. **Cover Art Upload**
   - Option to upload album/track artwork
   - Image preview
   - Basic image editing (crop, resize)

4. **File Transcoding**
   - Convert uploaded files to standardized format(s)
   - Quality settings for transcoded files
   - Generate multiple formats/bitrates for adaptive streaming

5. **Progress Tracking**
   - Upload progress indicators
   - Transcoding status
   - Error reporting for failed uploads

### 3. Existing Content Management

#### Search & Browse
1. **Search Interface**
   - Search by any metadata field (title, artist, album, etc.)
   - Advanced filtering options
   - Sorting capabilities (newest, alphabetical, etc.)

2. **Batch Operations**
   - Select multiple tracks for batch editing
   - Batch delete functionality
   - Batch tag application

#### Edit Workflow
1. **Metadata Editing**
   - Edit any field in the MongoDB schema
   - View edit history (optional)
   - Validation to ensure required fields are populated

2. **Audio File Replacement**
   - Replace the audio file while maintaining metadata
   - Option to retain or replace transcoded versions
   - Maintain the same track ID but update the audio content

3. **Cover Art Management**
   - Replace existing cover art
   - Remove cover art

## Specific User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Album Upload
1. Admin logs into the system
2. Selects "Batch Upload" option
3. Drags 12 tracks from a new album
4. System extracts basic metadata from files
5. Admin fills in common fields for all tracks (album, artist, release year)
6. Admin uploads album cover art, which is applied to all tracks
7. System begins uploading and transcoding files to R2
8. Upon completion, system shows success message with links to new entries
9. All tracks are now available in the music catalog website

### Scenario 2: Metadata Correction
1. Admin searches for a specific track that has incorrect information
2. Selects the track from search results
3. Edits the incorrect metadata (e.g., fixes misspelled artist name)
4. Saves changes
5. System updates MongoDB record
6. Changes immediately reflect on the music catalog website

### Scenario 3: Audio File Replacement
1. Admin identifies a track with poor audio quality
2. Locates the track in the management system
3. Selects "Replace Audio" option
4. Uploads new high-quality version
5. System transcodes the new file
6. Original R2 files are replaced with new versions
7. MongoDB record is updated with new file information and timestamps
8. Audio URL remains the same to maintain continuity for users who saved it

## Technical Requirements

### R2 Integration
- Direct integration with Cloudflare R2 API
- Secure credential management
- Efficient multi-part uploads for large files
- Proper bucket organization strategy

### MongoDB Integration
- Connection to MongoDB for CRUD operations
- Schema validation before database writes
- Efficient querying for fast search results
- Proper error handling for database operations

### User Interface
- Responsive design for use on different devices
- Intuitive navigation
- Clear status indicators for operations
- Dark/light mode options (optional)
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users (optional)

### Performance Considerations
- Background processing for transcoding
- Upload chunking for large files
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed content
- Pagination for large catalog browsing

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Frontend**: React or Vue.js for a dynamic single-page application
2. **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API development
3. **File Processing**: FFmpeg for audio transcoding
4. **Database Access**: Mongoose ODM for MongoDB interactions
5. **Storage**: Direct integration with Cloudflare R2 SDK
6. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
7. **Deployment**: Docker containers for easy deployment
